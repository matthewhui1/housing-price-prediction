# Zillow House Price Prediction

This was a final project for my Time Series Analysis class. I worked on this project with two teammates, Stephen Embry and Shiqi Tao. A final report of this project as well as the code and data associated with this project.

## Project Description
Data Description:
- The Zillow dataset (modified) recorded median selling price for housing in California, median morgage rate, and median unemployment rate for every month in California from February 2008 to December 2015.

Goal:
- Create the best time series model (using cross validation) in order to best predict the monthly median sold price between Jan, 2016 - Dec, 2016.
